# Linear Algebra with Numpy: Tasks

1. Take a picture you have taken recently and load it in Python
2. Convert that picture to a numpy array
3. Write a function to show the numpy array as picture again
4. Use multiple linear algebra functions to change the picture, find the best improvments for the picture and post it into our slack channel: #TODO DEFINE SLACK
