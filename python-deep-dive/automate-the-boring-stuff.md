# Automate the boring stuff
> This is an extracurricular activity. This means it is optional, but we highly encourage you do to it. You don't need to do the tasks right now though, you can also skip it for now and finish it later.

Based on the idea of a famous Python book, we ask you to use your learned Python skills from the last chapters for something productive of you.

The task is simple: Find something in your life what you need to do, and automate it away with Python. Upload your solution as Pull-Request to this repository: TODO REPO
