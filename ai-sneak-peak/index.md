# AI Sneak Peak

This chapter will build upon your previous skills but also introduce new concepts. AI is a very broad term. The AI-part in this section is an introduction to deep learning with neural networks. It provides a bit of theory but focuses on building working solutions with existing frameworks and architectures quickly. We will begin by showing you how things can be done and gradually require you to take the necessary steps. After this sneak peak/introduction you are very well prepared to go deeper into AI to understand the theory and many applications. If you like what you see here we strongly recommend you take the AI track in the upcoming semester.

## What you will learn in this section
- What it mean to use Deep Learning
- Regression with NNs using fast.ai
- Image Classification with NNs using fast.ai

## How you will learn

As this is a sneak peak we won't teach you everything to know or everything you should know. If that is what you are looking for you are still on the right path! If the topics of AI and Deep learning interest you and you like what you see in this section we highly recommend you to do the AI-track in your upcoming semester!

We will provide you with a short introduction and then jump straight into using deep learning. This is possible through fast.ai which allows you to use state-of-the-art deep learning techniques even if you are just starting out. You will go through three notebooks. The first two will require you to follow us and understand and once in a while use your own skills. The last one will provide you with some guidance but you will have to do most of the work to achieve the desired outcomes. At the end you should be ready to train a highly accurate image classifier for any domain you want.
Of course there is more to AI and Deep Learning than highly accurate pet classifiers, these things will then be covered (with practice and theory) by the AI track.
