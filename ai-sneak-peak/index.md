# AI Sneak Peak

This chapter will build upon your previous skills but also introduce new concepts. AI is a very broad term. The AI-part in this section is an introduction to deep learning with neural networks. It provides a bit of theory but focuses on building working solutions with existing frameworks and architectures quickly. We will begin by showing you how things can be done and gradually require you to take the necessary steps. After this sneak peak/introduction you are very well prepared to go deeper into AI to understand the theory and many applications. If you like what you see here we strongly recommend you take the AI track in the upcoming semester.
