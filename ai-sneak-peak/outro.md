# AI Outro

The notebooks you just worked on introduced you to the vast topic of AI and Deep Learning.
You now know a couple of basic building blocks and are ready to start your journey into AI.
Congratulations!

## What you have learned
- the basics of the fast.ai library
- loading and preparing data for deep learning
- Regression on tabular with deep Neural Networks
- Image Classification using deep Neural Networks

## What's next?

If you are curious to learn more we invite you to join the AI-Track of your respective TechLabs Chapter. Here you will learn much more about deep learning, you will dive into the theory of deep learning and learn to build working solutions in a variety of deep learning domains!

We hope to see you there!
