# Our expectations about you

Talk about what we had in mind what our techies should know and have done before they start with the course


* Finished your Data Science Python Course 100%!
* Finished group project
Both above are because we are building on top of these lerned skills.

* Terminal before (If not show them material)
For most of the times we expect you to run things local.
* Worked with Git before
Most of our tasks are stored on GitHub. For some tasks we ask you to submit your solution via GitHub :)
