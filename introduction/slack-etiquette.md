## Slack

- Please fill out your Slack Profile, Status and upload a picture.
- Treat Slack as you treat email/WhatsApp: read often (we recommend once a day, at least), post whenever you feel like it and reply often 
- Engage in conversations, reply to questions (even if you are not 100% sure that you are right), at least by selecting an emoji reaction to the messages. This goes a long way to show people are listening!
- Do not be afraid to post questions (yes even the ones that may make you feel stupid because you missed a comma somewhere in your code), interesting links and articles (and memes!), or anything you may judge of general interest to the community
- Answer in threads, which makes the discussion easier to follow and more focused.
