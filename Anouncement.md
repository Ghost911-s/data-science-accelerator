Hey @channel,

you are near the end of the project phase, and thus the whole DS track, but we feel that neither your Techlabs nor Data Science journey should end here.
@Maximilian Schall and I spent the last week creating a special new program:
**The Data Science Accelerator**

**What?**
The Data Science Accelerator is a **20h program**, which has the goal to deepen your knowledge of Python & Data Science, as well as giving you a sneak peek into deep learning(AI) to accelerate your skills and to prepare you well for next semesters AI track.

Some of the topics you will encounter:
- Advanced Python Features
- How to use your tools effectively and how to write good code
- Anomaly Detection
- Image Classification with Deep Learning
- and much more!

**How?**
The data science accelerator will be focused on learning, as well as practicing these learned skills in real-world problems. There won`t be a big project phase, but a lot of tasks that will require communication with the community and experimentation on your part. (You are of course always encouraged to collaborate with other learners!)

The program will also be **less** step-by-step than your previous program. It is more adapted to real-life problems and will require some thinking, research and reading on your part.

**Who?**
We open the program to students who have **received their certificate** and **finished their Data Science track 100%**
The program will include students from all locations, so you have the chance to meet Data Science learners from all over the world!
The programm will be managed by @Maximilian Schall, me and possibly some other mentors.

**When?**
The programm **does start once our current semester is over**, and we plan finish it before our upcoming semester starts, so probably from mid of February until mid of April. We designed the program that it can be finished in 6 weeks spending one evening a week (roughly 3h).
