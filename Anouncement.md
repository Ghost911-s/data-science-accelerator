Hey @channel,

you are near the end of the project phase, and thus the whole DS track, but we feel that neither your Techlabs nor Data Science journey should end here.
@Maximilian Schall and I spent the last week creating a special new track:
**The Data Science Accelerator**

**What?**
The Data Science Accelerator is a **20h program**, which has the goal to
deepen your knowledge of Python & Data Science, as well as giving you a sneak peek into deep learning(AI) to accelerate your skills and to prepare you well for next semesters AI track.
Some topics you will encounter:
- Advanced Python Features
- How to use your tools effectively and how to write good code
- Anomaly Detection
- Image Classification with Deep Learning
- and much more!

**How?**
There will be no big project phase but some smaller tasks that will require some communication with the community and experimentation on your part. (You are of course always welcome to collaborate with other learners!)
The track will also be **less** step-by-step than your previous program. It is more adapted to real-life problems and will require some thinking, finding and reading on your part.

**Who?**
We open the program to students who have **received their certificate** and **finished their Data Science tracks 100%**
The program will include students from all locations, so you have the chance to meet Data Science learners from all over the world!
The programm will be managed by @Maximilian Schall, me and possibly some other mentors.

**When?**
The programm **does not have a fixed starting date**, but will close once all locations have started their summer semester.
