# Awareness for documentation

> A common way of solving problems as a developer is to simply google it. Often, the first answer is a Stackoverflow thread and also very often the code can be just copied and slightly adapted to solve the searches problem. Unfortunatly, these are often not the optimal answers or the approach failes completly.

### Why you should read documentation

### Where to find documentation
Usually the best way is to google the specific library you are using and going to the website of that library.

A good example for this is: https://scikit-learn.org/

### Documentation in the Python universe
https://pypi.org/project/pip/

### What to do if even the documentation fails
- Look in the Github Repo of the library, and check the issues (Also the closed ones)

- Look at the code of the library
