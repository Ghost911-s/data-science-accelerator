# How to find data

> Finding data is one of the more creative parts of data science! Sometimes you need to work on already existing data, but often there are at least some parts missing and you need to venture out into the depth of the internet to find what you need. 

### Quick Wins
Some pages to find prepared data already:
-  Google DataSearch
- Kaggle 
- Data.world
- Public Data Providers
    - e.g. Berlin
    - data.gov
### Create own dataset
Often there is no dataset available for your required tasks. In that case it is often a good idea to identify where the data might be and then use web-scraping to scrape the data from a website.
